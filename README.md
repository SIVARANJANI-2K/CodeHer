## Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology       |
|---------------|------------------|
|  Frontend   | React            |
| Backend    | Flask            |
| AI Models  | Stable Diffusion, ControlNet |
| APIs       | PiAPI, Gemini API |

##  How It Works

1. **Sketch Upload**  
   - User uploads a hand-drawn sketch via the React frontend.

2. **2D Model Generation**  
   - The sketch is sent to the Flask backend.
   - ControlNet + Stable Diffusion (from RunwayML) is used to enhance and generate a detailed 2D model.

3. **3D Model Generation**  
   - The generated 2D image is passed to **PiAPI**, which returns a fully-formed 3D model.

4. **Context & Descriptions**  
   - The Gemini API is optionally used to generate a textual description of the model or assist with understanding the sketch.
